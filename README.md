3D Version Control


Below is a ChatGPT description on how it likely woudld be done.

1. Model Normalization Layer:

Purpose:
Before committing a model to the revision control system, convert it from the native format (which may reorder points arbitrarily) into a stable, canonical intermediate format.

Approach:

Canonical Ordering of Vertices:
Identify a method of sorting vertices consistently—for example, by spatial position and stable UUIDs assigned once and tracked over time. This might involve a pre-processing step:
Assign a persistent unique ID to each vertex (or mesh element) when first imported.
Store a mapping from native model indices to these stable IDs.
Abstract Representation:
Use a format like JSON or a binary schema (e.g., Protocol Buffers) with stable ordering and references. The normalized format should be designed for diffing and merging rather than direct editing by users.
Tooling Required:
A custom importer/exporter for the target CAD formats (e.g., STEP, IGES, OBJ, FBX, GLTF) that:

Imports the model into the internal canonical format (normalization).
Exports it back out to the native CAD format on demand.
This step ensures that the revision system works on a stable, diff-friendly representation.

2. Handling Large Files and Storage Optimization:

Binary and Large Files:
For very large meshes, consider using a binary diff-friendly format (like a stable mesh data structure) that can be delta-compressed. Tools like Git LFS can still be leveraged to store large binary blobs, but the key is having them structured so deltas are meaningful.

Chunking the Model:
Break the model into smaller chunks (e.g., individual meshes, materials, textures) that can be separately versioned and fetched. Textures, for instance, might be treated as separate artifacts stored in a dedicated asset store, while meshes are handled in the revision layer.

Compression and Caching:
The normalizer could also apply geometry compression (like Draco for mesh data) before storage. This reduces file size and can make diffs smaller if the compression preserves some structure.

3. Semantic Diffing and Merging Tools:

Visual Diff Tool:
A separate application or plugin that:

Loads two versions of a normalized model.
Aligns them (if necessary) to account for changes in reference coordinates.
Highlights differences in geometry (added, removed, or moved vertices/faces), changes in materials, or skeleton modifications.
This would provide a human-understandable representation of what changed.
Heuristic Matching:
When vertices or entire sub-meshes move, a heuristic-based approach could try to match corresponding geometry. For example:

Compare bounding volumes, face counts, and connectivity graphs to identify “the same” parts even if they’ve moved.
For skeletons (bones), match by name if available, or use hierarchical structure matching to align corresponding bones.
User-Assisted Merging:
If the tool gets stuck, provide an interface for the user to manually indicate which parts correspond. For example, a UI to select a bone in version A and say “this corresponds to bone X in version B.” This interactive assistance helps the system learn or guess matches better.

4. Modularizing Components (Meshes, Bones, Textures):

Separate Files for Separate Components:
Rather than a single huge file, maintain a directory structure:

model.json (master index of sub-components)
meshes/mesh1.json (or .bin)
meshes/mesh2.json …
materials/material1.json
textures/texture1.png
Each component can have its own version history, allowing smaller diffs and more manageable merges.

Combining into a Final Model:
A "build" step (similar to how code is compiled) would reassemble these components into a single CAD file for editing in the target program. This step might be akin to how a package manager assembles dependencies into a working environment.

Development Strategy
Start Small and Open Source a Core Library: Begin with the simplest case: handling static meshes (no rigging, no complex hierarchy).

Create a normalizer for a common format like OBJ or GLTF.
Develop a JSON-based canonical representation of the mesh that sorts vertices, edges, and faces consistently.
Implement a diff tool that can show changes between two mesh versions visually.
By open sourcing this core library, you invite community contributions. Others in the industry, who have been looking for such a solution, may contribute exporters/importers for other formats, improvements to diff heuristics, and optimization strategies.

Add Complexity Iteratively: After establishing a base solution for static meshes:

Introduce skeletal meshes and rigs (bones), possibly using named references to stabilize identification.
Handle materials and textures by referencing them as separate assets.
Develop more sophisticated diffing heuristics and user-assisted tools.
Integration with Existing Tools: Eventually, you’d provide plugins for popular CAD or DCC (Digital Content Creation) tools like Blender or Maya. These plugins would handle import/export, allowing an artist to pull the latest version, make changes, and push updates back through the normalizer.

Performance and Optimization: As the system matures, focus on making normalization and diff calculations more efficient. Caching results, parallelizing computations, or using GPU-accelerated libraries for geometry processing could help.
